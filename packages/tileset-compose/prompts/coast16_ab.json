  "global_preamble": "[STYLE] Top-down pixel art; crisp clusters; minimal dithering; no text or watermark. [TILEABILITY] Seamless when cropped to 32×32 and repeated. [UNITS] 1 tile-pixel ≈ 3% of tile width (≈32 image px on a 1024×1024 canvas). [ALPHA] Canvas has transparency; any area not covered by A (Land) or B (Water) is fully transparent; no halos; no AA. [COVERAGE] Every pixel belongs to exactly one of: Land (A), Water (B), Shore-Foam (on B side), or Wet-Band (on A side). No background pixels inside the tile area. [OPACITY] Inside A/B/Shore areas, alpha is 100% (no semi-transparent pixels, no glows). [PALETTE] Use ONLY the project palette. Foam = pure #FFFFFF (or project foam); Wet-Band uses darkest Land swatches; optional specular flecks use lightest Water swatches. [OUTLINE RULE] No contour outlines on Water; no black contour at A↔B—Wet-Band is the only dark edge there. [COAST STYLE] Coastline is orthogonal and stepped with 2×2 tile-pixel crenellations repeating every 4 tile-pixels, phase aligned to the tile origin (top-left). [INTERFACE] Along every A↔B boundary: apply Shore-Foam 1 tile-px on the B side (sparse speckles) and Wet-Band 2 tile-px on the A side (slightly darker A). [ALIGNMENT] Straight coasts snap to x=16 or y=16 midlines; corners are right-angle stair turns consistent with the 2×2 crenellation grid; allow ≤1 tile-px jitter only inside the crenellation pattern (not at midline crossings).",
